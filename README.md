 # This README will evolve as we work. 

As of right now, there are two issues created in the repo. Anyone can take those and complete them.

As for features, etc. rather than come up with a list of them to start, each person should create the issue for the feature they want to add (whether it's a component, functionality, whatever) then assign themselves that issue. This way we won't duplicate efforts. 

 # Let's at least follow this basic gitflow protocol:

- feature branches created from development and merged into development via pull request. 

-Since this is just practice, anyone can code review and accept pull requests until we have a more specific protocol
